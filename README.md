# AWS SDK for JavaScript Service Workers

This is a fork of the [AWS JS SDK v2](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js) with modifications to make it compatible with [Service Workers](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers).

## Build

To generate the full unminified SDK, run the following:

```
npm run-script build
```

The `aws-sdk-2.xxxx.x-sw.js` file will be generated for you in the project root.
